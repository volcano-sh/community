# Adopters of Volcano

Below are the adopters of project Volcano. If you are using Volcano to improve scheduling or job management in AI/ML, big-data, etc,
please feel free to add yourself into the following list by a pull request. There're several phases as follow:

* **Evaluation:** Known Volcano, that's interesting; evaluating the features/scopes of Volcano
* **Testing:** Take Volcano as one of candidates, testing Kubernetes cluster with Volcano
* **Staging:** Decide to use Volcano, testing it in pre-product environment
* **Production:** Already put Volcano into product environment
