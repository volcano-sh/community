# Volcano Governance

## Principles

The Volcano community adheres to the following principles:

- Open: Volcano is open source community.
- Welcoming and respectful: See [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
- Transparent and accessible: Changes to the Volcano organization, Volcano code repositories, and CNCF related activities (e.g. level, involvement, etc) are done in public.
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with
  project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Expectations from Maintainers

Every one carries water...

Making a community work requires input/effort from everyone. Maintainers should actively
participate in Pull Request reviews. Maintainers are expected to respond to assigned Pull Requests
in a *reasonable* time frame, either providing insights, or assign the Pull Requests to other
maintainers.

Every Maintainer is listed in the
[MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md)
file, with their Github handle.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Please see the requirement [here](community-membership.md#maintainer)

## Changes in Maintainership

If a Maintainer feels she/he can not fulfill the "Expectations from Maintainers", they are free to
step down.

The Volcano organization will never forcefully remove a current Maintainer, unless a maintainer
fails to meet the principles of Volcano community,
or adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Decision making process

Decisions are build on consensus between maintainers.
Proposals and ideas can either be submitted for agreement via a github issue or PR.

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out between the persons involved.
If a dispute cannot be decided independently, get a third-party maintainer (e.g. a mutual contact with some background
on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
If a dispute still cannot be decided, the project lead has the final say to decide an issue.

Decision making process should be transparent to adhere to
the principles of Volcano project.

All proposals, ideas, and decisions by maintainers or the project lead
should either be part of a github issue or PR.

## Github Project Administration

The __volcano__ GitHub project maintainers team reflects the list of Maintainers.

## Other Projects

The Volcano organization is open to receive new sub-projects under its umbrella. To accept a project
into the __Volcano__ organization, it has to meet the following criteria:

- Must be licensed under the terms of the Apache License v2.0
- Must be related to one or more scopes of the Volcano ecosystem:
  - Volcano project artifacts (website, deployments, CI, etc)
  - External plugins
  - Other AI/BigData related processing
- Must be supported by a Maintainer not associated or affiliated with the author(s) of the sub-projects

The submission process starts as a Pull Request or Issue on the
[volcano-sh/volcano](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano) repository with the required information
mentioned above. Once a project is accepted, it's considered a __CNCF sub-project under the umbrella
of Volcano__.

## Volcano and CNCF

Volcano is a CNCF project. As such, Volcano might be involved in CNCF (or other CNCF projects) related
marketing, events, or activities. Any maintainer could help driving the Volcano involvement, as long as
create a GitHub Pull Request to call for participation
from other maintainers. The `Call for Participation` should be kept open for no less than a week if time
permits, or a _reasonable_ time frame to allow maintainers to have a chance to volunteer.

## Vendor Neutrality

Volcano is an independent open source project committed to vendor neutrality as defined by the CNCF. Project direction is determined by the community and maintainers based on technical merit, not by any single vendor or organization.

**Key Principles:**

- **No single organization controls the project**: No vendor has unilateral decision-making authority over project direction, features, or governance
- **Multi-organization maintainer base**: Maintainers represent multiple organizations (current affiliations listed in MAINTAINERS.md)
- **Merit-based decisions**: Technical decisions are based on merit, alignment with project goals, and design principles, not organizational affiliation
- **Equal contributor rights**: All contributors have equal rights regardless of employer; contributions are evaluated on technical merit
- **Open path to leadership**: Any contributor can become a maintainer through demonstrated contribution and community trust, as documented in community-membership.md
- **Consensus-based governance**: Major decisions require consensus among maintainers from different organizations
- **Transparent processes**: All governance processes, decisions, and discussions happen publicly on GitHub

For more details on CNCF's vendor neutrality principles, see the [CNCF Vendor Neutrality Guidelines](https://contribute.cncf.io/projects/best-practices/community/vendor-neutrality/).

## Decision Making

### Requests to CNCF

For formal requests to the CNCF (such as graduation applications, budget requests, or trademark usage), any maintainer can propose the request via a GitHub issue. Other maintainers review and discuss the proposal. The request proceeds when maintainers reach consensus, and the submission is coordinated by one of the maintainers.

### Modifying Governance

Changes to governance documents (GOVERNANCE.md, community-membership.md, etc.) are proposed via Pull Request with clear rationale and follow the standard PR review process. Changes are merged when approved by maintainers.

## Meetings

Volcano does not hold regular scheduled meetings. Maintainers coordinate asynchronously through GitHub issues and pull requests to accommodate different time zones and work schedules. Ad-hoc meetings can be proposed by any maintainer via GitHub issue when synchronous discussion is beneficial. Meeting notes are documented in the relevant issue.

## Code of Conduct

The [Volcano Code of Conduct](https://github.com/volcano-sh/community/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) is aligned with the CNCF Code of Conduct.
